		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			I have been working with server-side, page-centric MVC web frameworks
			for so long that it's hard to imagine anything else. But imagine
			there's no server. (It's easy if you try...)
		</p>

		<p>		
			In this talk, we'll look at the emerging wave of client-side, 
			component-oriented single page web frameworks like Backbone.js. 
			They'll turn many long-held "best practices"
			on their ear, requiring a significant change to the way you 
			architect your applications and look at web development in general.
			There's nothing wrong with the traditional, server-side approach 
			to web development, but if you are interested in making sure that
			your website works well in tablets and smart phones -- especially in
			"Airplane-mode" -- single page web apps are something that should
			be on your radar.
